# MPI program for implementing averaging algorithm for distributed clock synchronisation on any number of (even or odd) processors.

The program displays
1. Î”t value for each processor
2. Synchronised time for every processor

This also demonstrates clock synchronisation for different clock drifts values among the processors.

Note: MPI process may be represented as a physical processor.
